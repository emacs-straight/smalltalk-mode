;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode to edit GNU Smalltalk code (http://smalltalk.gnu.org/)
;; and interact with an inferior GST interactive session.

;; Provides the usual functionality:
;; - Keyword highlighting.
;; - Automatic indentation.
;; - Syntax-aware navigation.
;; - Code templates.
;; - Interacting with an Smalltalk REPL from within the source code.

;;; Old History:

;; Incorporates Frank Caggiano's changes for Emacs 19.
;; Updates and changes for Emacs 20 and 21 by David Forster
